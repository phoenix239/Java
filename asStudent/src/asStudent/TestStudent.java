	/*The method main will do the following:
		Prompt the user to enter the total number of students (say n).
		Create an array of n references (for holding n Student object references). (The Student objects will be created in the next step).
		Create n Student objects. Do this by setting up an n count loop. In each pass through the loop, do the following:
			Ask the user to enter data for one student in a single dialog box.
			Separate data elements using a StringTokenizer object.
			Create a Student object initialized with data provided by the user and store its reference in the appropriate element of the array of student references created above.
		Display the student results by grade type. First display all students with grade A, then all students with grade B etc. Do this using one of the following two methods. (It is suggested that you use method II as it will help you to learn about String arrays).
	Method I.
			Create five empty Strings, outA, outB, outC, outD, outF. Use the String outA for storing output relating to A students; use String outB for storing output relating to B students; etc. Use the object accessor methods to access object values as needed. At the end, prepare a String outAll that concatenates all the above five Strings. Then display the String outAll.
	Method II.
			Create a String array out of 5 Strings. Use out [0] for accumulating output relating to A students,   out[1] for B students etc. Write a static method displayRestult to display output. Call the static method displayResult and pass it the array out.
			
			displayResult
			
			For method II above, write a static method displayResult. This method will receive a String array and display the contents of all elements of the String array one by one. Here is a proposed header for the method:
			public static void displayResult (String [ ] s){
			}
			You may use either the method I or method II above. However, it is suggested that you use method II as it teaches you how to use String arrays.
			The sample code given below uses method II for doing the output.
